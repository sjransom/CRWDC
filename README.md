This app let's you create a list of things you'd like to do, it will then decide and display for you which option to choose.

You may also add and remove items that are kept in localstorage.

To run:
```javascript
yarn run dev-server
```

##### I created this app following Andrew Mead's excellent [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/) on Udemy.
